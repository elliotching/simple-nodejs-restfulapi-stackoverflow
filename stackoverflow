First , I would give my example in Node.JS app. I guess yours is in python, but it should works the same.

Use this simple api to get your public IP. Call this api in your heroku app. I get this from https://www.ipify.org/

```
https://api.ipify.org?format=json
```

Example Code:

```
const axios = require("axios");

async function main() {
    const result = await axios.get(
        "https://api.ipify.org?format=json"
    );

    console.log(
        `result ip: ${JSON.stringify(result.data)}`
    );
    // ...
    // ...
}

```

Once you push your code to heroku , and your app is running , you should see the IP you have called in your app.

```
2024-07-18T03:01:17.611991+00:00 app[web.1]: result ip: {"ip":"184.72.212.113"}
```

Next, go to your MongoDB Atlas Network Access and add this IP.

! But, don't add full IP, instead you changed the last 2 bytes or 1 bytes as flexible. For example 184.72.212.113 , last 2 bytes would be the '212' and '113', the IP might change from time to time but we can still limit it to a certain range. so we add in `184.72.0.0/16` or `184.72.212.0/24` . Take note that `/16` means to fix the first 2 bytes (8bits * n). if u want fix full IP , 8 x 4 = 32, `/32`, and there are `/8`,`/16`,`/24` and so on...
(Please ignore the 0.0.0.0 in my screenshot for sample purpose, in this case it can access from anywhere)

Now you should be able to access your DB from your heroku.
